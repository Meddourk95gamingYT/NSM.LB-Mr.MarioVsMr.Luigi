# NSM.LB-Mr.MarioVsMr.Luigi ![nslbv1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a42b1c6-ad7a-4ca1-b8ba-beaba996f318)

A Mod of the unity-standalone 2-10 player remake of the Mario vs. Luigi gamemode from the New Super Mario Bros DS download game. 

Includes the 5 default levels (Grassland, Bricks, Castle, Pipes, and Ice), along with a handful of custom levels to battle on! 
All power-ups are included and remain faithful to their original counterparts, along with the new addition of the Propeller Suit & Ice Flower!
